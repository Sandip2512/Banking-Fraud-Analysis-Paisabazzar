## Project Summary:
This project focuses on credit score analysis for Paisabazaar, a financial services platform that connects users with credit and banking products. The aim is to analyze customer data — including income, credit usage, and payment patterns — to classify and predict credit scores. This helps optimize risk assessment, reduce loan defaults, and improve personalized financial recommendations.

## Univariate Analysis
We explored individual features like Age, Income, Credit_Score, Credit_Utilization_Ratio, and Interest_Rate. These insights help understand customer demographics, assess financial health, detect class imbalance, and identify high-risk groups based on credit utilization and loan costs.

## Bivariate Analysis
The relationship between features and credit scores was studied using box plots and bar plots. Key patterns emerged, such as older customers typically having better credit scores, and delayed payments or multiple active loans often aligning with lower scores. Occupational patterns were also identified to refine customer profiling.

## Multivariate Analysis
Pair plots and correlation heatmaps highlighted relationships between income, debt, credit history, and utilization. This deeper view guided feature selection for predictive modeling and identified high-impact factors influencing credit risk.

## Conclusion:
The analysis of customer data provides valuable insights into the factors influencing credit scores and offers guidance for Paisabazaar's credit assessment processes. Key findings include a focus on the working population aged 25-45, a significant portion of customers with moderate to high earning capacity, a balanced credit score distribution with a notable portion having poor credit scores, responsible credit management among customers, a competitive market with varying interest rates, and the importance of age, income, credit utilization, and payment history in influencing credit scores. These findings offer valuable insights for Paisabazaar to refine their credit assessment models and improve risk management strategies by focusing on specific customer segments and tailoring their financial product offerings. Additionally, the analysis highlights the need for continuous monitoring of credit score trends and customer behavior to stay updated with evolving financial landscapes.
